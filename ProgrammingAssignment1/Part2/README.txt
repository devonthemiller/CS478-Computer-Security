This part of the assignment involved performing a buffer overflow attack on a simple program. The goal was to circumvent the password protocol in the program and go straight to the success state. In order to find the right input, we had to look at the memory addresses in the program and then construct the input that, when entered, would get pushed to the stack and trick the program into going to the address given to it (that of the success condition). The full command used to overflow the program can be found in answer 5 of report.txt. In order for this attack to work, the C file was compiled without stack protection.
