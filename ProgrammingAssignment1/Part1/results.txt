Message (with spaces): EVEN THOUGH WE DONT KNOW WHICH COMPANIES THE NSA HAS COMPROMISED OR BY WHAT MEANS, KNOWING THAT THEY COULD HAVE COMPROMISED ANY OF THEM IS ENOUGH TO MAKE US MISTRUSTFUL OF ALL OF THEM. THIS IS GOING TO MAKE IT 
HARD FOR LARGE COMPANIES LIKE GOOGLE AND MICROSOFT TO GET BACK THE TRUST THEY LOST EVEN IF THEY SUCCEED IN LIMITING GOVERNMENT SURVEILLANCE. EVEN IF THEY SUCCEED IN IMPROVING THEIR OWN INTERNAL SECURITY THE BEST THEYLL BE ABLE TO SAY IS WE HAVE SECURED OURSELVES FROM THE NSA EXCEPT FOR THE PARTS THAT WE EITHER DONT KNOW ABOUT OR CANT TALK ABOUT.


When I generated the automatic key from my program, I noticed what looked like the word "surveillance" in the plaintext. Using manual cryptanalysis, I substituted all the appropriate letters to complete the aforementioned word which then caused most of the rest of the message to become solved already. From there I simply substituted letters to complete words that were off by only one or two characters. After that the message was basically deciphered and I got the final message and key.
